Week 9 of project:
Currently, we have our ship, asteroid and material files are working as of
now. However,we are still learning SDL and its mechanics. So far, we have
gotten a SDL window display with our ship displayed on it but it becomes
buggy when we tried to display the asteroids with it. We are currently
trying to get the ship moving, as well as displaying all the asteroids
with it. We're also trying to make interactions with the ship and asteroids
in getting the materials from the asteroid and adding it on the ship's
inventory. And if possible, we would like to put some more add-ons with
our projects if time allows us.
